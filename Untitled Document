why is there an extra 9 in x coordinate?
how to highlight the effected part while dragging?

[...element parent].indexof to get index..

i am not sure if i should use new codes i don't quite understand yet in my program. like..http://jsfiddle.net/nGRwt/7/
or just install some plugins(libraries) that does the desired functions for me.

the code for matching the ship with grids was long and look terrible.

i can't drag my ships to the right
